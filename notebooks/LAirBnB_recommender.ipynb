It's close to everything! 5-15 minutes away from the most popular spots in Los Angeles (Glendale, Echo Park, Pasadena, Alhambra, Burbank, Downtown, etc). Also, this area has become one of the safer parts of Los Angeles over the past few years. The $1 billion LA River project is in full effect.  Many families live on this block, kids play on the street, and the neighbors are super friendly. There are bars and a fire station nearby and it does get pretty noisy around here during weekends. We do provide earplugs for our guests! We're currently renovating the exterior, starting with the roof/paint. The neighborhood is a bit old and isn't well-lit but we're doing our best to renovate. We've had a few \"Am I in the right place?\" moments from guests but they quickly (URL HIDDEN) what's on the inside that counts. :) In the interim, we just want to provide a fun, safe, and comfortable space for everyone.

The block that goes along the river has always been industrial buildings. I am in one of the industrial buildings, about a 200 ft walk down to the river trail. We enjoy about the lowest crime rate in LA because there are no through streets and no retail, so no reason to loiter. This makes the neighborhood very quiet and peaceful at night.\n",
